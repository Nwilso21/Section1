This is my submission for Excercise 1.1 of Careerfoundry's python course. In this section the primary goal was the creation of a developer environment for Python that I will be able to use when coding the rest of the class.

This folder contains two .py files add and hello. Hello outputs a generic "Hello world" and add will take in the value of two numbers as integers and will return a string displaying the sum of the two inputs.

The folder also contains a requirements .txt file which lists all required packages needed to run the code.

To run the files locally, install python, download the repository, then run pip install -r requirements.txt to intall all local packages, then follow up with $ python add.py (or hello.py if you prefer)
