This section contains a file called recipe_mysql.py

This files interacts with a local sql database I have running on my PC

It will not function unless you have the same database created and running on your local machine in the exact same configuration

In the event you did file can be ran with python recipe_mysql.py

The file runs a menu that has 4 option 

    Add recipe - Adds a new recipe to the sql database
    Search ingredient- shows all ingredients in the database and returns all recipes based on the selection you make
    Update ingredient - shows all recipes and allows you to change a desrired one
    Deleted recipe - Deletes a recipe from the database
